WS2812 16x16 frame

Project to create a frame for 16x16 pixels images using an Arduino Pro Mini, controlled by infrared remote control.

Description:

The project aims to implement a program that displays a 16x16 pixel RGB image using a WS2812 led matrix controlled by an Arduino Pro Mini. The program loaded on the Arduino will perform the following tasks:

- Reading image files from SD Card: The program will read files in "led" format, generated by the "imgextract" program.
- Infrared remote control (currently deactivated): From the remote control you can change the default images using others saved on the SD card.
- WS2812 matrix control

The project is divided into the following directories:

Root directory:
- Project for arduino IDE.
Extras Directory:
- NEO Pixel and IR remote libraries
ImgExtract directory:
- Extra program to generate image files in compatible format with the program recorded in the arduino. There are compatible sample "png" files, and output "led" files to put on the SD card.
